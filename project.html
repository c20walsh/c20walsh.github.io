        <div class="col-md-6">This was the final project in COMP 390 Software
            Engineering. This program looks at a text file that contains certain meteorite data
            and is able to filter that data by multiple parameters. It also is able to output the
            data to both a text file and an excel file. <img class="nophone imagesize" src="meteor.png"></div>
        <div class="col-md-4">This project was the first bit of code I have ever wrote. It's
            pretty simple, but it works. <img class="nophone imagesize" src="firstjava.png"></div>
      </div> 
    <p><br><br>Final project idea: I am currently unaware of the standards and required size of the project, so I am not set on any ideas at the moment.
